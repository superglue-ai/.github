<h2 align="center">Integrate & orchestrate APIs with natural language. 🍯</h2>

<h3 align="center"> Now live: let agents build deterministic workflows across apps, databases and APIs using the superglue MCP<br>
Let's glue.<br>

[Read the docs](https://docs.superglue.cloud/mcp) 🍯🍯🍯</h3>

superglue automates API workflows from natural language. Tell it what you want to do with any API and superglue builds, runs and executes the integration pipelines automatically. Comes with automated schema mapping, pagination, retries and remappings so your workflows keep running no matter what. 
superglue makes agents reliable in prod by letting them build deterministic workflows across any SaaS app, API and data source. Use the superglue MCP instead of hard-coding tools and let your agent use APIs the way they want to, not the way they were written. 

- Lightweight proxy: point it at any REST / GraphQL / SQL / postgres / file endpoint.
- LLM‑assisted mapping during config; cached Javascript transforms at runtime (no LLM latency).
- Self‑heals schema drift: when the upstream API or schema changes, superglue regenerates the transform automatically, and keeps the pipeline running.
- Security‑first: zero data stored; run fully on‑prem or use [our hosted version](https://app.superglue.cloud/).
