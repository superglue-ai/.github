<h2 align="center">one SDK to manage all your data pipelines. üçØ</h2>

superglue bundles your pipelines into one stable, self-healing endpoint. Comes with automated schema-drift detection, retries and remappings so your data keeps moving no matter what - no connector maintenance, no rewrites. You can deploy it as a proxy between you and any SaaS app, API and data source and always get the data that you want in the format you expect.

- Drop‚Äëin proxy: point it at any REST / GraphQL / SQL / file endpoint.
- LLM‚Äëassisted mapping at setup; cached JSONata transforms at runtime (no LLM latency).
- Self‚Äëhealing drift detector: when the upstream schema changes, superglue regenerates the transform, bumps a version, and keeps the pipeline running.
- Security‚Äëfirst: zero data stored; run fully on‚Äëprem or use our hosted version.
- Agent‚Äëready: every pipeline is exposed as a single, deterministic endpoint that LangChain, Retool or internal no‚Äëcode tools can call without knowing the ugly stuff underneath.
