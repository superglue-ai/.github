<h2 align="center">API connector that writes its own code üçØ</h2>

superglue lets you connect to any API/data source and get the data you want in the format you need. It‚Äôs an open source proxy server, which sits between you and your target APIs. Thus, you can easily deploy it into your own infra.

Here's how it works: You define your desired data schema and provide basic instructions about an API endpoint (like "get all issues from Jira"). Superglue then does the following:

- Automatically generates the API configuration by analyzing API docs.
- Handles pagination, authentication, and error retries.
- Transforms response data into the exact schema you want using JSONata expressions.
- Validates that all data coming through follows that schema, and fixes transformations when they break.
